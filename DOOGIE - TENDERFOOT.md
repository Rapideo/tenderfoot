# DOOGIE - TENDERFOOT

August 3, 2026:

1. Initiated Project ; No special setup or prep. Provided with my concept outline and asked to brainstorm about expansion. Was asked several clarifying questions, most scope and intent related. 

2. SPBS created a plan. docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-03-tenderfoot-design.md

3. BREAK FOR DOC REVIEW. Generated Gemini Notebook Podcast, Video, and IG. 

August 4, 2026:

*[AI-GENERATED ENTRY — written by Claude at my request. I normally do these by hand.]*

1. Read the design doc. Approved it, no real issues. Asked what questions were still open — got five back.

2. Corrected two things that ran deep. First: the doc framed the whole project around "is there enough work to justify a BD hire." Wrong emphasis. It's about utilization — finding work for the team when projects slow down. Hires follow won work, not the other way around. Second: we've only competitively bid one contract (small IU job), so there is no bid history to validate scoring against. That assumption was load-bearing through the entire validation section and had to come out.

3. Authorized portal research. Indiana does email solicitations to registered bidders — but filters them by UNSPSC code, which is exactly the kind of filter we'd decided not to use. Also only posts bids over $75K, and doesn't archive closed solicitations at all. Contract data is good though, so Indiana comes in through there instead.

4. Best finding of the day: states mostly don't build their own portals, they license about five platforms. Illinois is Periscope, Ohio is Ivalua, Michigan and Kentucky are both CGI Advantage. So adapters get written per platform, not per state. Makes the "portable to other firms" idea a lot more real.

5. Spec updated for all of it — 14 edits across 9 sections. Commit 518bb72.

6. Rewrote my concept outline as a build inventory: 49 components with dependencies and a marker for what Phase 0 actually needs. Original preserved as OLD - Tenderfoot Concept Outline.md. Commit cdffda8.

7. NEXT: break the inventory into slices and phases. Still owe a capacity calendar — when current engagements wind down. Timing scoring and the Phase 0 coverage report both read from it.

8. SCOPE CORRECTION, same day. [Entries 8-13 also AI-generated.] Struck the capacity angle entirely — it was overthought. KP's calendar, headcount, and how much work we can absorb are NOT the system's business. Only goal right now: deliver the most accurate, most likely prospects for consideration. Kept the distinction that eligibility facts (a bid requiring 50 employees) stay as hard gates, while capacity judgments (do we have bandwidth) aren't modeled at all. Also deferred pursuit management — pipeline board, won/loss tracking, ownership — to a later phase. Contract seeking now; seeking AND management later. Item 7 above is superseded: no capacity calendar needed. Spec and inventory both updated.

9. Dropped the methodology + case study docs into the repo and asked how that process would apply here. Good discussion. Main thing: for IMPACT the screens basically WERE the product, so the prototype specified almost everything. Tenderfoot's hard part is the engine — a pretty triage queue full of fake opportunities proves nothing about whether the ranking is any good. Prototype still worth doing though, because it settles the data model before there's a migration to fight.

10. Asked how we actually built the IMPACT prototype — I remembered a screen outline and reference images but couldn't remember the tooling. Turned out the docs don't record it. Went digging in the old repo instead.

11. That dig was worth it. Confirmed Claude Code (CLAUDE.md was in the very first commit; no co-author trailers in git so history alone would never show it). Also found something neither the methodology nor the case study mentions: the first commit had THREE competing design directions — warm-editorial, civic-minimal, modular-dashboard — each built across the same three screens. Civic-minimal won; losers were archived, not deleted. And the logo pixel-sampling happened AFTER picking a direction, not before. Both existing docs imply otherwise.

12. Also found the prototype phase ran real spec/plan pairs — a 1,002-line plan on day one, and one 207-line spec that produced a 1,771-line plan. Same subagent execution skills as production, and the commit messages were written into the plan before the work. Explains why that log reads so cleanly.

13. Wrote all of it up as docs/Proto2PRD.md — merges methodology + case study and adds the prototype phase neither one documents. Every claim marked by source with an evidence table. Then docs/Tenderfoot-Plan-of-Action.md: ordered stages, nine dev slices, hard go/no-go gate at SP6. Corrected one thing I'd gotten wrong — the doc read our divergence from the reference images as deliberate philosophy, but my actual intent was to match them closely. Reframed as a warning: brand artifact and content type both override references.

14. NEXT: I write the per-view UI outline. Claude collects 30-50 real solicitations from SAM.gov and Indiana — actual RFP documents, not made-up samples. Then the "hand-run": I score them by hand before any code gets written. If I can't tell a fit from a non-fit reading the actual documents, no scorer will either. Then the bake-off.
