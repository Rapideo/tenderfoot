# Tenderfoot — status

**Updated 2026-08-14.** One screen. The reasoning lives elsewhere; this is only where things stand.

> **Now: SP2 is SIGNED OFF (2026-08-14) and clear to merge.** Sixteen primitives on `/dev/gallery`, reviewed against the V1.2 bundle with no issues raised; **all five gate rulings resolved** — two of them turned out not to be what the gate list said. Three fixes applied (`--type-body-default` → `--type-body-para`/`-detail`, `StatusDot` `degraded` → `failing`, and `npm run dev` now loads `.env`), gate re-run **green: 92 tests, 20 files, exit 0**.
>
> **Also closed today:** all three of `three_open_questions.md`, and the full twenty-node SVRC `Imp`/`Pri` re-score (v0.6.0, fourteen moved).
>
> **Credential rotation is COMPLETE — both branches, 2026-08-14.** `main` was rotated first (old string proved dead, new one live, 201 solicitations intact). **`test` rotated today**; `DATABASE_URL_TEST` re-derived from the unpooled endpoint and the **full gate re-run green on it**.
>
> ⚠️ **One honest limit on the `test` rotation.** Per lesson §2.16 a revocation is proved by the OLD key failing, not the new one working — and **the old `test` string was overwritten before it was captured**, so that negative test could not be run. Neon's dialog asserts the old password is invalid; nothing here demonstrates it. **The `main` rotation was proved properly; this one is asserted.**
>
> **All three Neon console changes are done** — test-branch password, compute default `0.25 → 8`, and the project rename. Nothing is pinned for Matt.
>
> Behind it: SP1 T12–T15 still outstanding (mock-layer re-extraction, minimal admin UI).

## 🔖 RESUME HERE — pinned at the end of the 08-14 session

**State is clean.** On `main`, working tree clean, **SP2 merged** (`ebbcf7c`), gate green *after* the merge — exit 0, 20 files, 92 tests, every token check passing. Nothing is half-finished and nothing is uncommitted.

### Matt — one urgent, three whenever

**1. 🔴 Create the remote and push. This is the only thing blocking anything.** Decided public at `Rapideo/tenderfoot`. `gh repo create` is blocked for Claude by the permission classifier, so it has to be Matt:

```
gh repo create Rapideo/tenderfoot --public --source=. --remote=origin --description "Tenderfoot -- government contract opportunity discovery for Koehler Partners. React + Express + Postgres on Neon, deployed on Vercel."
git push -u origin main
git push origin sp2-design-system
```

> **Expect CI to fail on that first push and do not read it as a regression.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is correct and **has never executed once**. Likely first-run causes: Windows-vs-Linux path assumptions, or `DATABASE_URL_TEST` not existing as a GitHub Actions secret. Paste the output and Claude fixes it.
>
> **Also settled before pushing:** history carries no real credential (the only matches are a discarded `tenderfoot:tenderfoot@localhost:5433` Docker placeholder), `.env` was never tracked, largest blob is 3.8 MB. **Matt chose to publish the live infra identifiers and the credential-incident write-up as-is**, having been asked specifically about both.

**2. Where long ingestion runs — the one that actually blocks Claude.** Bounded candidate scrape / durable workflow / off-platform. This is the question the hosting decision created and did not answer: the host solves *when* ingestion runs, not *how long it may take*. It is coupled to a measured number — **~7 rows/second against a 300-second function ceiling**, which does not survive an 8,000-record contract register. **B3 for SP3 cannot be written without it.**

**3. Two SP4 decisions, not yet needed.** Extraction runtime (Node / Python sidecar / smart mode — the largest open question in the stack) and the blob provider.

**4. `THOUGHTS.md`** — whether the two live ideas become real backlog items.

### Claude — next session, in this order

1. **Per-preview DB branching** (workflow spec §8, six steps). **Until it is done every preview deployment writes to the production database.** Status changed on 08-14: its prerequisite is met (compute default now 0.25→8, so new branches are born right) **and it is no longer Matt's to click** — the browser extension works, so Claude can drive it.
2. **§6 slice-order reconciliation** — unblocked by Q3. Two inputs to apply: `Shell A`/`Region A.1` dropped to `Pri 3`, so **§6 must now state "build the shell first" on its own** rather than inheriting it from a score; and `Screen 7` rose to `Pri 4` and **must not move earlier** — its `PARKED` marker holds it.
3. **SP1 T12–T15** — re-extraction, minimal admin.
4. **SP6 preconditions** — recessed-section primitive, spacing/shadow layers, `Button` danger-primary.

### One open thread that is nobody's task yet

**The `test` branch rotation is asserted, not proved.** The old string was overwritten before it was captured, so the negative test could not run — the failure mode that `Proto2PRD.md` §5.4 now exists to prevent. If it ever matters, the only way to close it properly is to rotate again, capturing the current string first.

## ~~Waiting for Matt at the SP2 gate~~ — ✅ SIGNED OFF 2026-08-14

**Matt drove `/dev/gallery` against the V1.2 bundle and passed the visual review with no issues raised.** The five rulings were then walked through individually and all resolved. **Two of the five were not what the gate list said they were.**

| Ruling | Outcome |
|---|---|
| **98 type tokens** | ✅ **Census accepted, one name fixed.** Measured: **17 of 88 font tokens are actually consumed**; the 25-member `--type-body-*` family is 7 sizes × 8 leadings, of which **four are used**. Kept as a census — parity outranks elegance and 17/88 means nobody yet knows which survive a real screen. **But `--type-body-default` (12.5px, 7 uses) was outweighed by `--type-body-default-2` (11px, 11 uses)** — a token named "default" that wasn't, beside the family's most-used member hidden behind a positional `-2`. Renamed **`--type-body-para`** and **`--type-body-detail`**, *in the generator as well as the emitted file* |
| **No spacing layer, no shadow layer** | ✅ **Accepted, with a date instead of a "later."** Extract when the second consumer appears; sixteen primitives and **zero composed screens** cannot distinguish systematic spacing from incidental. `Card`'s `rgba` shadow has exactly one consumer. **Now a named SP6 precondition** |
| ~~**`StatusDot`: `rot` = yellow, `degraded` = red**~~ | ✅ **Not backwards — the colours were right and the NAME was wrong.** The bundle is coherent: *"Rot suspected"* is a suspicion and warns yellow; *"Failing"* is confirmed and errors red. The apparent inversion came from the state being called **`degraded`**, picked *"by elimination"* rather than from the bundle — and "degraded" reads as *less* severe than "rot." **Renamed `degraded` → `failing`** to match the bundle's own label. TypeScript union member: **zero parity impact, nothing rendered changed.** The four states now read green/yellow/red/grey in plain ascending severity |
| ~~**`--brddash` is misnamed**~~ | ✅ **Already fixed; struck from the list.** It is `--line-dashed` now with the description corrected, `--brddash` retained as one of ~16 bundle-name aliases. **Nothing consumes either** — the only dashed affordances are the two unimplemented singletons. This row was stale |
| **Gaps in `Button`** | ✅ **Danger-primary deliberately not added.** It is `confirmReason`'s pass branch (`--bad`/`--baddk`), driven by app state rather than any prop — no consumer exists, and building a variant ahead of need is what the 3× recurrence bar prevents. **Deferred to SP6 as a named precondition**, because it is a *destructive confirm* and SP6 composes the decision bar. The two singletons (`toggleDrawer`, dashed "+ New view") stay out unless they recur |

### SP6 preconditions — three items, one gate

Named together so they cannot be rediscovered piecemeal. **None block the SP2 merge; all three block SP6 composing a real screen.**

| | Why it waits for SP6 |
|---|---|
| **A "recessed section" primitive** | The bundle's `COST TO PURSUE` panel sits in a `--surface3` recessed wrapper no primitive expresses, so the gallery draws it on plain white. Colour difference is near-imperceptible — **the real gap is the missing primitive, not the colour** |
| **Spacing + shadow token layers** | Extract when a composed screen shows which values are systematic |
| **`Button` danger-primary** | A destructive confirm; decide the affordance when the decision bar exists |

## Infrastructure — live, re-read from the account 2026-08-14

| | |
|---|---|
| Vercel | project `tenderfoot`, team `koehler-partners`, beside `kp-web` |
| Neon | project `wispy-tooth-06225229`, named **`tenderfoot-db`** since 2026-08-14, org `Vercel: Koehler Partners`, beside `kp-web-prod`. Postgres 17, `aws-us-east-1` |
| Billing | **`launch_v3` (Launch), subscription** — same org and bill as the website |
| `DATABASE_URL` | pooled endpoint, injected by the integration into all three environments |
| Compute — existing | ✅ **resized 0.25 → 8 CU on both computes 2026-08-13**, verified by reading back. The `test` compute had been the tighter of the two at 0.25→0.25 |
| Compute — **default** | ✅ **set to `0.25 → 8` CU 2026-08-14**, read back on the settings page. Governs computes that do **not exist yet** — new branches are now born right. Neon's own dialog states the §2.17 hazard verbatim: *"Modifying these defaults does not alter the settings of any existing computes"* |
| Branches | `main` (`br-super-breeze-aun4swjv`) · `test` (`br-delicate-leaf-auwo0czn`). **Role passwords are per branch** — **both rotated 2026-08-14** |
| ✅ **Rename** | **`neon-lime-button` → `tenderfoot-db`, done 2026-08-14 from the VERCEL dashboard.** The Neon console refuses it outright — `action restricted; reason:"organization is managed by Vercel"`. The spec had predicted the two names were independent strings with Neon upstream; **it is the reverse** — renaming the Vercel resource renamed the Neon project, confirmed by reading it back through the MCP. Details in workflow spec §10.1 |

## Waiting on Matt

**Nothing here blocks SP0–SP2 any more.** The sign-off gate, all three open questions, and all three Neon console changes closed on 2026-08-14.

| | Blocks |
|---|---|
| ~~🔴 **The SP2 sign-off gate**~~ | ✅ **SIGNED OFF 2026-08-14.** Gallery reviewed against V1.2, no issues raised; all five rulings resolved above. **SP2 is clear to merge** |
| ~~`three_open_questions.md`~~ ✅ **ALL THREE CLOSED 2026-08-14.** Q1 `Pri` = product priority · Q2 parked nodes keep their scores and carry a `PARKED` marker · Q3 all twenty re-scored, **fourteen moved**. `Imp`/`Pri` are rulings now, not placeholders. **The §6 slice-order reconciliation is unblocked** | ~~Slice order from SP3 on~~ — now Claude's |
| ~~User stories~~ | ✅ **93 drafted 2026-08-12** — `docs/user-stories-source.html` and the published story map. Yours to edit |
| **Extraction runtime** — Node / Python sidecar / smart mode | **SP4** |
| ~~🟡 **Rotate the Neon credentials**~~ | ✅ **BOTH BRANCHES DONE 2026-08-14.** `main` proved by the old string failing; `test` reset and `DATABASE_URL_TEST` re-derived, gate green. ⚠️ **`test` is asserted, not proved** — the old string was overwritten before capture, so the negative test could not run. See `Proto2PRD.md` §5.4 |
| 🔴 **Per-preview database branching.** Six numbered steps in workflow spec §8; dashboard-only. **Until it is done, every preview deployment writes to the production database.** ✅ Its prerequisite is now met — the compute default is fixed, so branches created by this feature are born at 0.25→8. **Claude can drive this in the browser now; it no longer needs to be Matt's** | SP2 onward |
| ~~🟡 **Set the project compute DEFAULT**~~ | ✅ **`0.25 → 8` CU, done 2026-08-14**, read back on the settings page. New branches are now born right |
| ◐ **A git remote — DECIDED 2026-08-14: create one, public, at `Rapideo/tenderfoot`.** Repo verified publishable (no credential in any commit, `.env` never tracked, largest blob 3.8 MB). **`gh repo create` is blocked for Claude by the permission classifier — Matt runs it.** The first push turns CI on for the first time ever | Decide before SP3 |
| ~~Express or framework route handlers?~~ | ✅ **Ruled 2026-08-13: Express stays.** Workflow spec §9.5 stays open on its own terms; the port did not decide it by momentum |
| **Which blob provider** — Vercel Blob / S3 / R2 | **SP4** |
| **Where long ingestion runs** — bounded candidate scrape / durable workflow / off-platform. **The one the hosting decision created and did not answer:** the host solves *when* ingestion runs, not *how long it may run* | **SP3** |
| ~~Doc storage on filesystem~~ · one-database-per-firm · auth in V1 | **Auth got sharper — it is a public URL now, not one laptop** |
| Ingestion scaffolding brainstorm | **SP3** |
| ~~Prototype V1.2 — wordmark, mobile breakpoints~~ | ✅ **Both closed 2026-08-13.** V1.2 landed and was verified against V1.1 rather than trusted (colours 132→132, media queries 0→0, `display:flex` 74→73 — exactly the one disclosed wrapper). **The wordmark item turned out to be a deletion, not a design** — the logo already existed; only the 8px placeholder *label* was provisional. **Mobile ruled desktop-only** by measurement, not instinct; a separate mobile client is now plan of record |
| 📎 **`THOUGHTS.md`** — ✅ **tracked 2026-08-14**, committed verbatim. Four ideas from 08-11. **Two bear on open questions:** *levels of research and qualifying against that research* collides with the qualification work spec §1.1 parks as **undesigned** — note the collision, don't resolve it — and *what analysis 20+ years of historical data enables* is real against the 2,160-contract corpus (Illinois backtests to 2018). The other two are V2-shaped, past SP8. **Still to decide: promote the live two into backlog, or leave filed** | Nothing |

## Waiting on Claude

| | |
|---|---|
| ~~B3 for SP0~~ · ~~B3 for SP1.5~~ · ~~B3 for SP2~~ | ✅ written and executed. SP2's scope grew 2026-08-13 — the parked intelligence chrome is built inert, so it was never "mostly transcription" |
| SP1 T12–T15 | Re-extraction + minimal admin |
| **B3 for SP3** | **Next**, but gated: §9.6 (where long ingestion runs), the round-trip fix, and the scaffolding brainstorm all land in the plan rather than after it |
| **A "recessed section" primitive** | The one known SP2 gap, ruled not gate-blocking. Needed **before SP6** composes `FactPanel` into a real screen |
| **The ingestion round-trip fix** | **Blocks SP3.** ~7 rows/sec against a *measured* 300s function ceiling: an 8,000-record register is ~19 minutes and does not fit. Multi-row `INSERT`/`UNNEST` |

---

## Decided this week

- **V1 returns everything active sources return.** No ranking, scoring or filtering. Matching parked as *undesigned* (spec §1.1)
- **Hand-run retired permanently.** Not deferred
- **Stack:** ideate/IDE8 — React 19, Vite, Zustand+Immer. Minus dnd-kit, plus a router
- **Persistence and hosting, 2026-08-13 — reversed from the day before.** ~~better-sqlite3 local-first~~ → **Neon managed Postgres, hosted on Vercel.** Not two decisions: Vercel has no writable persistent filesystem, so a SQLite file cannot survive a request there. **Zero data lost** — `*.db` was gitignored from SP0 and the database is rebuilt from `corpus/` and the seed migrations. Cost is the code: ~600 lines, all in the merged slice
- **Prototype is reference-only** and represents the finished product
- **The intelligence chrome is BUILT, inert — decided 2026-08-13.** Score strips, AI-assessment panels, smart-filter controls and their settings are all constructed and rendered, none wired. A build that omitted them would not be a subset of the product but a different one, with holes where screens were composed around content. **Supersedes fidelity mandate §7.10 clause 2**, which said parked regions are not built. **Affects SP2 scope directly.** The guard that comes with it: *a rendered control may never become a live filter or score until qualification is designed* — same shape as the Capacity rule, artifact permitted, data flow forbidden. **How "vestigial" should look is undesigned and stays that way until Matt specifies it**
- **Legal posture rule:** ambiguous terms default a source to `out`; documented permission moves it `in`
- **Sources:** Illinois `in` and backtest-capable (2,155 closed to 2018) · Michigan + Kentucky `in`, current-only · Ohio `manual-only`

## Known risks

- 🔴 **NEW — a leaked database credential is still live on the `test` branch.** Rotation closed `main` and not `test`, because a Neon role password is per *branch*. **Verified by connecting, not assumed:** the old `main` string fails auth, the old `test` string still works. One console reset closes it. **The general rule this produced — a revocation is proved by the OLD key failing, not the new key working** — is lessons `2.16`
- 🟡 **NEW — the compute default that mints future branches is still wrong (1→1 CU).** Harmless today because every compute that exists was fixed; wrong the instant anything is created. **The spec had already written the warning and it happened anyway.** Lessons `2.17`

- ~~**Deployment expires at SP7.** A closed laptop does not scrape~~ **RETIRED 2026-08-13** — Vercel Cron answers it. Arrived four slices early, with the answer attached
- ~~**A second reader means a second copy**~~ **RETIRED 2026-08-13** — managed Postgres answers it
- **NEW — long ingestion may not fit one function invocation.** §5.3 fetches in three hops and was written assuming a process that could run for minutes. **Blocks SP3**
- **NEW — documents need a blob provider and a bill.** `document.path` now means a blob key; there is no filesystem. Thousands of bundles to 21 MB. **Blocks SP4**
- **NEW — we are on a serverless database that suspends when idle.** This is the IMPACT failure's exact shape, not an analogy. Plan limits get **measured and dated** into workflow spec §10.1, never recalled
- **Extraction is the only thing V1 can be right or wrong about**, and Node is weak at `.docx`/`.xlsx`. **The Python-sidecar option got more expensive** — on Vercel it is a second deployment target, not just a second runtime
- **Four silent-failure instances across three source platforms.** Every new adapter runs the vary-one-parameter check
- **Volume is unmeasured.** If the sources are loud, V1 feels like the portals it replaces
